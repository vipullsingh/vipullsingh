ðŸš€ My Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on recently:

[Buddy Cart](https://github.com/vipullsingh/dirty-quilt-1530)
BuddyCart is a group project that was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. It is an e-commerce platform that allows users to shop for their favorite items online. The project's primary goal was to provide a user-friendly interface that would allow customers to easily browse and purchase items.

[ShoeKeeper](https://github.com/vipullsingh/ShoeKeeper)
The project at https://shoekeepermasai.netlify.app/ is an e-commerce website for purchasing shoes. The website features a clean and modern design, with easy navigation for users to browse through different categories of shoes such as women, men, kids and accessories. Users can also search for specific products using the search bar provided on the homepage. The website also has a shopping cart feature, allowing users to add items to their cart and proceed to checkout. Additionally, the website includes a section for rewards and offers, as well as a feature to find stores nearby. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web development technologies. The website is hosted on Netlify, a platform for building and deploying web applications. This website is a sample and not an actual e-commerce website.
